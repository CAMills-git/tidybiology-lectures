Combining two data frames is often required to integrate data from differents sources. Joining these data require a common variable between the two data sets to match the observations. The `dplyr` package of the tidyverse as a series of `join` functions that integrate two data frames in unique, and specific ways.  
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#load appropriate packages
library(tidyverse)
```
### What would I google to land on this page?
How do I combine all the columns of two datasets that have at least one column in common?  
How do I merge two datasets?  
How do I combine and drop variables between two dataframes?  

### Packages
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
getwd()
```

### Description
An Inner join is a type of mutating join. For two dataframes "x" and "y", it returns all rows from "x" where   there are matching values in "y", and all columns from "x" and "y". If there are multiple matches between "x"   and "y", all combinations of matches are returned

Inner joins are the simplest joins  

Here is an image illustrating how the various mutating joins (of which inner_join is one) work:

### Function
```{r form, eval = FALSE}
inner_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, suffix = c(".x", ".y"),
  ...)
```

### **Required input**
What arguments are required for this function to run:  

* **data**: two dataframes with at least one common column 

* **by**: "by" is one or more column names to join by. If "NULL", the join will be performed using ALL common column names

#### Example 1
For all the examples used in this help file, the following dataframes "x" and "y" will be used -
```{r make dataframe, echo=FALSE}
x <- data.frame(UniProtID = c("Q96M02", "Q9C0C9", "Q8TB40"),
                Protein_length = c(699, 1292, 342),
                Gene = c("C10orf90", "UBE2O", "ABHD4"),
                Chromosome = c(10, 17, 14)
                )

y <- data.frame(gene = c("C10orf90", "UBE2O", "ABHD4", "BCKDK"),
                Gene_length = c(373711, 63696, 14978, 6684),
                Chromosome = c(10, 17, 14, 16)
)

x
y
```

An example of an inner_join - 
```{r simple example}
inner_join(x, y, by = "Chromosome")
```

What is the goal of this example in relation to the example datasets?

The purpose of this example is to combine two datasets "x" and "y" using a common column called "Chromosome"

#### Example 2
To join by different column names in "x" and "y", use a named vector.  
For example, by = c("Gene" = "gene") will match the "Gene" column in "x" to the "gene" column in "y"

```{r different column names example, warning = FALSE}
inner_join(x, y, by = c("Gene" = "gene"))
```

In this case, note that since there was a "Chromosome" column in both dataframes, two new columns are created named   "Chromosome.x" and "Chromosome.y" to indictate the source of each column. If you want to change the default ".x" and ".y"   suffixes, make the necessary changes in the "suffix = " argument. For example, if you want the outputs to be   "Chromosome.protein" and "Chromosome.gene", run the following code -

```{r suffix, warning = FALSE}
inner_join(x, y, by = c("Gene" = "gene"), suffix = c(".protein", ".gene"))
```
