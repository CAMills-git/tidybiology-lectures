Happy to have you all in the bootcamp: Introduction to Biological Data Science in R. This workshop will be a comprehensive introduction to the emerging field of Data Science using the R programming language, including data analysis and visualization, with a particular focus on its utility for biological insight. You will be provided with biological datasets, and introduced to R packages and code used to examine data. In the first half of each class, participants will be lectured on methods and shown demonstrations; in the second half of each class, students will use tools to analyze real data; laptop computers are required. Methods for filtering, sorting, and transforming data will be discussed along with visualization tools and options. Particular attention will be paid to code interpretation and data provenance methods by learning to generate reproducible data output files. For a final project, each participant will be given datasets to analyze using the tools learned during the course, and will share findings with the class in a short oral presentation. Although specific datasets will be used for analysis in class, this workshop will provide broadly applicable tools to reproducibly analyze and visualize data across the biological sciences. Attached is one paper that I would encourage, but not require, you to read before class. Here is the [link](https://elifesciences.org/articles/43979). It is an opinion piece on how data science could be involved in several stages of the scientific method.
  
Lastly, I'm attaching pre-class instructions on laptop and software requirements for class. Please read this carefully and perform the pre-class install instructions.
  
If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to ask. 

See you soon,
matt
(and Allie and Akshay, your Co-instructors/TAs for the class)
