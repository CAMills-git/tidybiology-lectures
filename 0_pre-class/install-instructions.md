Thank you for enrolling in TidyBiology: An Introduction to Biological Data Science in R. To prepare for the class:

Please bring a laptop that has the following installed:

* A recent version of R (>=3.5.0), which is available for free at cran.r-project.org
* A recent version of RStudio Desktop (>=1.1.456), available for free at www.rstudio.com/download (RStudio Desktop Open Source License)
* The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command line:

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown"))

And don't forget your power cord!

Also, please sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/. On the day of the class, I'll provide you with an RStudio Cloud project that contains all of the course materials. We will use the software listed above only as an important backup should there be problems with the classroom internet connection.

Lastly, please sign up for and install Slack (https://slack.com). I have created a Slack channel for our work together at https://join.slack.com/t/tidybiology/signup, and will serve as an important resource for class and for your future projects. You can join the channel with your @duke.edu email address, or if you prefer to use your personal address, I can invite you on the first day of class.

I look forward to meeting you,
Matt
