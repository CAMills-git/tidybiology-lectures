Thank you for enrolling in TidyBiology: An Introduction to Biological Data Science in R. To prepare for the class, please complete the following instructions:

1. Please sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at [https://rstudio.cloud/](https://rstudio.cloud/). On the day of the class, I'll provide you with an RStudio Cloud project that contains all of the course materials. 

2. please sign up for and install [Slack](https://slack.com). I have created a Slack channel for our work together at [https://join.slack.com/t/tidybiology/signup](https://join.slack.com/t/tidybiology/signup), and will serve as an important resource for class and for your future projects. You can join the channel with your `@duke.edu` email address, or if you prefer to use your personal address, please repsond to this email with your preferred email address for an invitation.

3. As an important backup should there be problems with the classroom internet connection, please bring a laptop that has the following installed:

* A recent version of R (>=3.5.0), which is available for free at [cran.r-project.org](cran.r-project.org)
* A recent version of RStudio Desktop (>=1.1.456), available for free at [www.rstudio.com/download](www.rstudio.com/download) (use the RStudio Desktop Open Source License version)
* The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running two sequential commands at the command line:

`install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown", "devtools"))`  
`devtools::install_github("hirscheylab/tidybiology")`

If these instructions are scary or confusing, please reach out on the Slack channel and we can help you. 

As soon as you have completed these steps, **please introduce yourself on the #0_intros slack channel, by giving your name, lab you're currently in (joined or rotation), and experience with R**.
 
Lastly, don't forget your power cord!

I look forward to meeting you on the first day of class!
